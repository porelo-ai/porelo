# [B551](README.md#b551) — The Host Purges A Person And Restores Runtimes In Java

**Status:** Implementing, since 2026-11-10. Filed 2026-11-09 from the porelo-host CLI proposal the operator took (a module `host/` of porelo,
built by Agent Core and read by Agent Machines; built all at once: every issue of it on one branch, one hand-over, its real test
move 5). Priority to be set by the operator; nothing built before the operator's word after move 4.
**Size:** L.
**Blocked by:** [B550](README.md#b550).

**What must be true.** Purging a locked person (account, keys, Matrix account) and restarting each admitted person's user manager at up,
as `porelo-host-person purge` and `restore-runtime`.

## Why

Step 7, persons. The proposal (the operator's rule: what cannot run in user mode and is not done by a person is `porelo-host`'s;
the person it acts for is `SUDO_USER`, never an argument) places every host script's verb; porelo-host's collection
change is Machines' own, in porelo-host: the collection installs the `porelo-host` package, its units, timers,
sockets and sudo rules call it, and every host script goes. The contract between the two: porelo publishes the
`porelo-host` package with every verb of these issues, at `/usr/sbin/porelo-host`, before the collection pins it. `host/` is built by Agent Core and read by Agent Machines, the domain owner of the host scripts it replaces.
